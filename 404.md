# Text Replace plugin for Vendetta with Vencord Cloud Sync

The "Text Replace" plugin for Vendetta is a generic text replacement plugin. This fork of the original project adds the ability to sync the user's TextReplace rules for the Vencord Desktop plugin.
Currently you need to use [my fork of Vencord](https://github.com/HeLau1337/Vencord) as well if you want to benefit from this because saving the TextReplace rules in the Vencord Cloud is not the default behaviour in the official Vencord mod. It's only implemented in my Vencord fork but let's hope this will change in the future.

## How to install?

Paste this plugin's URL into the Plugins page of Vendetta:
